CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and \\nconsidered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent \\nCONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance \\n(workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes.  CONSULTANT is not entitled to \\nany employee benefits.  COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the \\nmanner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein. \\n  \\nPRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and \\nmeans of accomplishing the result contracted for. \\n \\nSECONDARY FACTORS\\n: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise \\nover the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct \\noccupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a \\nspecialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the \\nparticular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION \\nsupplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is \\nengaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the \\njob rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather \\nthan part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are \\ncreating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) \\nThe COMMISSION conducts public business. \\n \\nIt is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent \\nCONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate \\nthat CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT. \\n \\nBy their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered \\njudgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT. \\n \\n12.
